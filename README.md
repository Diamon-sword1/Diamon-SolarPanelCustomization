# Thanks to Ramune, EldritchCarMaker and the rest of the Modder Team in the Subnautica Modding Community Discord for being so kind to me when i wanted to become a modder and knew nothing about it.

To Install Simply drag the main folder with the mod name from the Zip file and place the folder in Subnautica\BepInEx\plugins
after that, it should apply if you check in the game, depending on what the mod is
