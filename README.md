# Thanks to Ramune and the rest of the Modder Team for being so kind to me when i wanted to become one of them.

To Install Simply drag the main folder with the mod name of the Zip file and place the folder in Subnautica\BepInEx\plugins
after that, it should apply if you check in the game, depending on what the mod is
